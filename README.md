#Danger Zones

View the latest travel alerts and warnings from the US state dept. in visual form.  The app highlights areas on the map deemed dangerous for travel.  Clickable countries expand to show the text of travel warnings along with links to NY Times news articles pertaining to that country.  

I'd love to hear feedback on the project.  I'm looking to expand the project to include several other similar news or data visualization tools.

###To Do:

- Chron jobs for NY times API
- Bring in other news sources
- Scrape other sources for relevant travel data
- Add option to get e-mails or text messages when country of interest has a new travel alert or warning issued

###Deployed!
